# Learning Data Structures & Algorithms

This is an effort to self-teach data structures and algorithms. It will be periodically updated with commits. Most of the code will be written in mostly C, with some being written in JavaScript, C++, or Python. As it is self taught, there will be multiple sources of the code, though all of it is self-written and revised. There may be errors present.

Sources will be listed at the bottom of this README.
